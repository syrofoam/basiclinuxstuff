*I belive the most of these files are personal ways of making the system customized.
You can check out and find insperation if you want.

```
autostart is for dwm top bar
kitty.conf is for kitty terminal
fish_prompt.fish is just a bash.rc for fish shell.
fzf_key_binding is for binding fzf search command hist.
